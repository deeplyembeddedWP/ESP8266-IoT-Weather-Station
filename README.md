# ESP8266-IoT-Weather-Station

This is an IoT project in which the ESP8266 behaves as Weather Station. The ESP does the following:

1. It will have the server side code i.e. HTTPÂ server, running on it, so it basically behaves as a server waiting to serve a web page on request from the client side i.e. the web browser.
2. It will also be responsible for communicating with the dht11 sensor and processing the sensor data.
3. The processed sensor data is integrated with the server-side response so that the webpage is always updated with the latest or new sensor data at every 10 to 15 seconds.
